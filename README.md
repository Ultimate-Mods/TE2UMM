# Issues

• Given Items dropped icons are blank.

• Random crashes if the game is running in background.

# Explainations

## The Give system

This is buggy and unstable, you should not use it.

Use add custom recipe instead.

You will have a menu with every prisons, click which one you want, then it will overwrite Center Perks 2.0 to the prison you clicked.

Saving and loading works. No issues found
